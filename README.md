# Customer_Churn_Analysis_-_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
This repository contains a complete workflow for customer churn analysis and prediction using machine learning. The project aims to help businesses identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain customers.
We developed a prediction model that predicts customer churn, providing results in the form of "yes" or "no." Additionally, we created a customer churn analysis dashboard using Tableau.
